# Coded in React + Vite ü§©

This Project is the 7th Codepath Project in Web102 YIPPEE!!!!!

This Project is a Website that allows the user to save information onto a Database by Creating a Crewmate from AmongUs. It also displays the information so you view all information stored in the database. Each Crewmate could be edited and deleted from the database.

It also creates a unique version of the Editing and Information page of each Crewmate by using the ID of the Crewmate. This allows the user to view the information of a specific Crewmate.

All the code looks like this:
